# AttributedString in iOS 15

* Over the years, Apple has made many improvements over old data types e.g., String (NSString), Date (NSDate), Calendar (NSCalendar).
* NSAttributedString allow us to associate attributes such as visual style and hyperlinks to a part of its string.
* In iOS 15, we got the new AttributedString, an improved version of NSAttributedString.
